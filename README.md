### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harley. I try to keep a low public profile, but unfortunately, a Github like this is a necessary evil. Hopefully I know you and you're not a stalker ðŸ‘€. 

- ðŸ¤” About me ... I'm a very keen recent graduate looking to improve her ever lacking coding ability. I enjoy most computer science domains but have a particular love for 3D graphics and visualisation.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... My cats, 3D PDFs and my spotify 
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I collect obscure designer clothes  

If you know me feel free to message, I'm always interested in project ideas or collabs. <br>
If you don't why are you here  ðŸ‘€
